## Project Description
In this project I analyzed the evolution of Bitcoin in the last 2 years comparing it with the evolution of some currencies and some tech stocks to look for any correlation.

## Questions & Hypotheses
Bitcoin is a crypto currency, but does it behave as a currency? Or maybe as a tech asset? Are there any other influences to its behaviour? 

## Dataset
There is lots of information about the evolution of currencies and stocks. You can download csv files from many webpages. Ones I used were: www.stooq.com, finance.yahoo.com and nasdaq.com

## Workflow
Firts I compared the evolution of Bitcoin against the evolution of three of the main currencies: US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen. As I didn't see a clear correlation, I looked for the evolution of some of the main tech companies in the world: Apple, Amazon, Alibaba, Microsoft, Samsung and Google. It looked like there was some kind of correlation between some of them and Bitcoin, but it was not clear enough. Then I looked for information about the peak of bitcoin in December 2017 and its immediate fall, and I found some news about a China's Government decision about ICO's. And finally I compare Bitcoin with Chinese Yuan and found a quite clear negative correlation.

## Organization
I organized all the tasks in Trello and added new ones when they appeared

I organized the repository in different folders regarding the part of the proccess:
In 'data' folder there are all the csv files I used for the project. And other folder named 'cleaned_data' with all the files after cleaning them.
Another folder named 'cleaning_data_files' contains all the files where I did the cleaning process for all the data. One file per csv.
There is a folder named 'analyzing_files' where I did some analysis in each topic: currencies, stocks, yuan, with some plots inside.
The final plots used in the slides are saved in the 'pictures' folder
